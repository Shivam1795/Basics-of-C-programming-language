# Basics-of-C-programming-language
**Basics of C programming language (Lab Sessions)**

**Lab1: To be familiar with different data types, Operators and Expressions in C.**

  Ex11: Write a program to display “hello world” in C.

  Ex12: Write a program to add two numbers (5 & 7) and display its sum.

  Ex13: Write a program to multiply two numbers (10 & 8) and display its product.

  Ex14: Write a Program to calculate and display/print the volume of a CUBE having its height (h=10cm), width (w=12cm) and depth (d = 8cm).

  Ex15: Write a program to calculate the area of a circle having its radius (r=5.0cm).

  Ex16: Write a program to calculate the area of an ellipse having its axes (minor_axis=4cm, major_axis=6cm).

  Ex17: Write a program to calculate simple interest for a given Principal_balance (p=4000), Time (t=2), Interest_rate (r=5.5). (I = p*r*t/100).
  
  
  
**Lab 2: To be familiar with different data types, Operators and Expressions in C.**


  Ex21: Write a program to take roll_no and marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects as input and display the roll_no with percentage score secured by the student.
      (Note: For each subject, maximum marks: 100, and total strength of the class is 50 students)
      
  Ex22: Write a program to declare two integers and one float variable, then initialize them to 10, 15, and 12.6. Also, print the variable values on the screen.

  Ex23: Write a C program to prompt the user to input three integer values and print these values in forward and reversed order.

  Ex24: Write a program to calculate simple and compound interest (Take Principal_balance(p), Interest_rate(r) and Time(t) as input from user).

  Ex25: Write a program to swap the values of two variables with and without using third variables.

  Ex26: Write a program to check if a given number is odd or even, using the modulus operator.

  Ex27: Print the value of y for given x=2 & z=4 and analyze the output.
            a). y = x++ + ++x;               b). y = ++x + ++x; 
            c). y = ++x + ++x + ++x;         d). y = x>z;
            e). y = x>z? x:z;                f). y = x&z; 
            g). y = x>>2 + z<<1; 

  Ex28: Write a program to print the size of char, int, float, double and long double data types in C.
