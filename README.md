**Basics of C programming language (Lab Sessions)**

**Lab1: To be familiar with different data types, Operators and Expressions in C.**

  Ex11: Write a program to display “hello world” in C.

  Ex12: Write a program to add two numbers (5 & 7) and display its sum.

  Ex13: Write a program to multiply two numbers (10 & 8) and display its product.

  Ex14: Write a Program to calculate and display/print the volume of a CUBE having its height (h=10cm), width (w=12cm) and depth (d = 8cm).

  Ex15: Write a program to calculate the area of a circle having its radius (r=5.0cm).

  Ex16: Write a program to calculate the area of an ellipse having its axes (minor_axis=4cm, major_axis=6cm).

  Ex17: Write a program to calculate simple interest for a given Principal_balance (p=4000), Time (t=2), Interest_rate (r=5.5). (I = p*r*t/100).
