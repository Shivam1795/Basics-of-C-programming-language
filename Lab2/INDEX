Lab 2: To be familiar with different data types, Operators and Expressions in C.


## INDEX ##

Ex21: Write a program to take roll_no and marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects as input and display the roll_no with percentage score secured by the student.
      (Note: For each subject, maximum marks: 100, and total strength of the class is 50 students)
      
Ex22: Write a program to declare two integers and one float variable, then initialize them to 10, 15, and 12.6. Also, print the variable values on the screen.

Ex23: Write a C program to prompt the user to input three integer values and print these values in forward and reversed order.

Ex24: Write a program to calculate simple and compound interest (Take Principal_balance(p), Interest_rate(r) and Time(t) as input from user).

Ex25: Write a program to swap the values of two variables with and without using third variables.

Ex26: Write a program to check if a given number is odd or even, using the modulus operator.

Ex27: Print the value of y for given x=2 & z=4 and analyze the output.
            a. y = x++ + ++x;               b. y = ++x + ++x; 
            c. y = ++x + ++x + ++x;         d. y = x>z;
            e. y = x>z? x:z;                f. y = x&z; 
            g. y = x>>2 + z<<1; 

Ex28: Write a program to print the size of char, int, float, double and long double data types in C.
